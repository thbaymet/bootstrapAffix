# BootstrapAffix

This is a simple static web project with one single page. The purpose of this project is to implement a web page content
with Affix and ScrollSpy plugins in order to have a fixed sidebar navigation. 

I've implemented almost the same behaviour which is presented on the Bootstrap's official documentation pages.
